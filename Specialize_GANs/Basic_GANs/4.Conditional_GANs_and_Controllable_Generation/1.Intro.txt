Over the past few weeks, your GANs had been getting
better and better, but you don't have much control
over what they generate. It's like at home
where you don't choose what type of cookie your
parent or guardian is making, you get oatmeal raisin and maybe tomorrow night
it's chocolate chip. This is what your
GANs I've been doing. It's called unconditional
generation. But in contrast to
that, at a restaurant, you can order on the menu
an oatmeal raisin cookie, or a chocolate chip cookie, or any other type of
cookie that's there. This is called
conditional generation. You tell your model to generate different items you specify
or condition on the menu, and you adapt the
training process so it actually does that. Similarly, there's
controllable generation. Running with the cookie analogy, this is about figuring out
how to adapt the inputs to your model without
changing your model or your chef and their process. It's like turning up or down the heat during
cooking in order to control certain
output features like how crispy or how
gooey your cookie is. This is true for both conditional and
unconditional generation. This week you'll have
two assignments, one on building a
conditional GAN, and the other on
controllable generation. Let's get started.
