Projects related to Deep GANs

- GANs are deep neural networks that are trained in an adversarial manner to generate data mimicking some distribution.
- Two classes of models in GANs:
(a) Discriminator: Discriminates between two different classes of data.
(b) Generator: It has to be trained on training data X sampled from some true distribution D is the one which, given some standard random distribution Z produces a distribution D', which is close to D according to some metric. e.g., It means our model should be trained on training datapoints X of Mnist dataset (from its original distribution D) in such a way to give a distibution D' which is generated from some random distribution Z. And the trained final distribution should be like of original distribution D.
